UI UX App Design by: [Pixel True](https://www.pixeltrue.com/free-ui-kits/fitness-app-ui-kit)

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.












How to fix errors like 
A problem occurred configuring project ':device_info'.
> Could not create an instance of type com.android.build.api.variant.impl.LibraryVariantBuilderImpl.
   > Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file. See https://d.android.com/r/tools/upgrade-assistant/set-namespace for information about setting the namespace.

     If you've specified the package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml, you can use the AGP Upgrade Assistant to migrate to the namespace value in the build file. Refer to https://d.android.com/r/tools/upgrade-assistant/agp-upgrade-assistant for general information about using the AGP Upgrade Assistant.


~/.pub-cache  
sudo ls ~/.pub-cache 
ls -ld ~/.pub-cache                                        
ls -l ~/.pub-cache
sudo chown -R $USER: ~/.pub-cache           
cd ~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/ 
ls       
find ~/.pub-cache -name "device_info*"
/Users/admin/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/device_info_plus-8.2.2/android/build.gradle
sudo /Users/admin/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/device_info_plus-8.2.2/android/build.gradle








Based on the error message, the issue is related to missing namespace configuration in the Android build file for the device_info plugin. This is a common issue when working with newer versions of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP). Here's how to fix it:

First, you'll need to locate and modify the build.gradle file of the device_info plugin. Based on your pub cache paths, you have multiple versions installed. Let's modify the active one.
Open the build.gradle file in the device_info plugin's android directory and add the namespace configuration. You'll need to add this inside the android block:

gradleCopyandroid {
    namespace 'io.flutter.plugins.deviceinfo'  // Add this line
    // ... rest of the android configuration
}

If you can't modify the plugin directly in the cache, you have a few options:
a. Upgrade to the latest version of device_info_plus (11.1.1 as shown in your cache) which should have this fixed:
yamlCopydependencies:
  device_info_plus: ^11.1.1
b. Or override the namespace in your app's build.gradle:
gradleCopyandroid {
  configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
      force 'io.flutter.plugins.deviceinfo:device_info:2.0.3'
    }
  }
}

After making these changes, run:

bashCopyflutter clean
flutter pub get

Then try building again:

bashCopyflutter run
The key issue here is that newer versions of AGP require explicit namespace declarations for all Android libraries. The device_info_plus plugin should have this fixed in newer versions, so upgrading to the latest version (11.1.1) would be the most straightforward solution.
Would you like me to help you with implementing any of these solutions? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Chelp me to locate and modify the build.gradle file of the device_info plugin.EditLooking at your pub cache paths from the terminal output, I can help you locate and modify the build.gradle file.
First, let's identify where your device_info plugin is located. From your error message, it seems you're using the base device_info plugin (not device_info_plus).
The path should be:
bashCopy~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/device_info-2.0.3/android/build.gradle
Let's verify and modify it:

First, verify the file exists:

bashCopycd ~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/device_info-2.0.3/android
ls build.gradle

Open the build.gradle file with a text editor. You can use nano, vim, or any text editor:

bashCopynano build.gradle

In the build.gradle file, locate the android block and add the namespace. The modified file should look something like this:

gradleCopygroup 'io.flutter.plugins.deviceinfo'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
    }
}

rootProject.allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

android {
    // Add this line
    namespace 'io.flutter.plugins.deviceinfo'
    
    compileSdkVersion 31

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 16
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }
}

Save the file:


If using nano: Press Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter
If using vim: Press Esc, then type :wq and press Enter


After modifying, clean and rebuild your Flutter project:

bashCopycd <your_project_directory>
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
Would you like me to help you with any of these steps? Let me know if you need help locating the file or if you encounter any issues while making these changes.
